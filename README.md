This is a web application that was created using the Flask framework. It can be used to see who is currently rowing during the Elfsteden Roeimarathon of our team. The Elfsteden Roeimarathon is a rowing tour in the Netherlands that is done in stages. It also shows the upcoming rowers and some statistics about the tour. A demo of what it looks like is shown below.
